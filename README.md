<p>Simple TCP port scan tool.</p>
<p>Created as a simple test tool to verify that a server can be reached via it's service tcp port. I performs only a tcp connect/disconnect without sending or receiving any data.</p>
<p>The name is a joke on ping which in many cases is not that useful to test network connectivity.</p>

Syntax : pong hostname port

Example : pong 10.10.1.80 80
